The system was created with the goal of providing a simple and intuitive platform that allows graduating students and companies to communicate easily.
Users of the platform will have the option to register either as Students or Recruiters.
Students will be able to view job announcements posted by recruiters, apply for job positions they are interested in and also review companies they have already worked for.
Recruiters will be able to publish job announcements, receive student job applications and invite other recruiters to manage specific job announcements.
